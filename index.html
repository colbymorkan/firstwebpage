    <p>I just watched the <strong>Dear Evan Hansen</strong> movie, and I don't know what I was supposed to take away from it other than that it's sad. It got <a href='https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dear_evan_hansen' title="Rotten Tomatoes" target="'_blank">horrible reviews</a> but I didn't think it was that bad</p>
